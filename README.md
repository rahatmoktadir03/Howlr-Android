# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Rahat Moktadir**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Howlr** is an Android app that recreates a Twitter-style landing page ‚Äî but built exclusively for wolves üê∫. It's a themed layout exercise using Jetpack Compose, with custom styling, a dark-mode aesthetic, and a fully custom tweet component designed for animals in the digital age. This project helped deepen my understanding of Compose layouts, theming, and design systems.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üåïüêæüì±

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate  
  - (Inspired by the Twitter login and tweet layout)
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout  
  - (Used Jetpack Compose's `Column`, equivalent to ConstraintLayout)
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView  
  - (Used `Image()` composable with a wolf logo)
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews  
  - (Used `Text()` for app name, tagline, call to action, and tweet content)

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [ ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added a stylized tweet component with username, tweet text, and social actions
- [x] Customized app theme with deep night colors (#0D1117 and #121212)
- [x] Added a dark blue border around the tweet using Compose‚Äôs `border` modifier

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **Twitter** app:

<img src='twitter-screenshot.png' title='Chosen Screenshot' width='100' alt='Chosen Screenshot' />

## Original App Layout (Optional Stretch Feature)

This stretch feature was not implemented in this project.

## Notes

- This was my first time building a non-XML Android layout using Jetpack Compose
- I learned how to work with composables like `Column`, `Image`, `Text`, and `Row`
- It was fun theming an app around wolves and giving it a personality
- I ran into issues with resource linking in XML early on, then successfully migrated to Compose which resolved them
